# Patches for a specific arch, arch family, OS, shared version(debian and raspbian can share patches) 
# and OS version go in their own subdirectory.
# To sum up, under every project-specific *.diffs directory you'll be able to  group you patches this way:
# * $ARCHFAMILY/ : aarch32 for the generic arm32 patches and aarch64 for the 64bit-specific ones
# * $ARCH/ : aarch64,armv6,armv7 specific patches, regardless of the OS
# * $OS/ : Regardless of the architecture, patches for a specific OS
# * $VERSION/ : Patches for a specific OS version, regardless of the actual OS name (Debian and Raspbian can both be "Stretch" and the same version of Ubuntu could be reporting a different name when asked)
# * $OS$VERSION/ : Patches for a very specific version of a distribution
# * $ARCH$OS$VERSION/ : Patches that apply only to an OS/Version on a specific architecture.
